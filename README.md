# Fault-Tolerant-Control-for-Nonlinear-Systems
In this project, I provide the simulation file for my article named "A Neural Adaptive Approach for Active Fault-Tolerant Control Design in UAV"
This project has been written on MATLAB version 2015a. After running the SIMULINK file, run the figuresss file to see the comparison between the proposed technique and the nonlinear dynamic inversion (NDI) controller.
